# export
20180531

This folder is used to export the models from the "models" folder in OBJ and STL format, to be later used with a 3d printer or another 3d cad program.

There still needs to be a lot of work done.

- [ ] Export the entire creation as a single OBJ or STL file
- [ ] Export in more formats
