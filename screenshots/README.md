# screenshots
20180531

This is where the screenshots are stored. For not it is very basic, requires imagemagick in linux installed, doesn't work in windows.

The code for the screenshots is in the main.py. I might move it to a seperate script file so I can work more on it.

This is optional, low priority feature and I might not develop it further.
