# info

This is where the text for the "info" section of the program is stored. For now you need to put the wikipedia link to the first line and the rest of the text at the second line.

TODO:

- [ ] Allow more links to social media sites (facebook, twitter, instagram etc)
- [ ] Change the text format (maybe make it csv also?)
