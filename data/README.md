In this folder go the csv files that describe the models contained within each "models" subfolder. 

For each folder you need to add only one csv file, no matter the number of .blend files. But in the csv file you need to discribe all the models in all the .blend files in that folder.

Example csv file: (00base.csv)
```
NAME,WIDTH,LENGTH,HEIGHT
cube.001,1.0,1.0,1.0
parallelepipedo.001,1.0,0.5,1.0
pyramid.001,1.0,1.0,1.0
cylinder.001,1.0,1.0,1.0
sphere.001,1.0,1.0,1.0
```
